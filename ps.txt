CoinedOne Founder’s Office: Phase 2
Challenge
"The Vault & The Closer"
Role: AI Engineer (Founder’s Office)
Timeline: +48 Hours from acknowledgment.
1. The Context
Your first prototype proved you can use LLMs to communicate. Now, you must prove you can
use them to sell securely.
Real estate decisions involve sensitive documents (Salary Slips, Bank Statements) and high
anxiety ("Am I making a mistake?").
Your current system likely has two fatal flaws:
1. It’s a Security Risk: Sending raw financial text to a public LLM API is a privacy violation.
2. It’s Passive: It waits for questions instead of driving the user toward a decision.
2. The 4 Objectives (MECE)
You have 48 hours to upgrade your prototype. You must hit all four objectives below.
Objective 1: The "Vision" Integration (Frictionless Input)
Users hate typing. They will not manually enter "Basic Salary," "Housing Allowance," and
"Deductions."
● The Task: Allow the user to upload a mock document (e.g., a simple image or PDF of a
Salary Slip).
● The Requirement: Your system must use a Vision model (like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
or an open-source OCR tool) to extract the relevant financial variables automatically.
● The UX: The bot should say, "Don't worry about typing. Just upload your salary slip, and
I'll run the numbers."
Objective 2: The "Privacy Firewall" (Security Architecture)
This is the most critical engineering test. We are dealing with PII (Personally
Identifiable Information).
If a user uploads a document containing their Name, IBAN, or Passport Number, and you send
that raw data to an external LLM provider for general chat, you fail.
● The Task: Architect a privacy layer.● The Requirement:
○ Redaction: You must demonstrate a method to detect and redact/anonymize PII
before it hits the reasoning model.
○ Separation of Concerns: The LLM needs to know the numbers (Income: 20k), not
the identity (Name: Ahmed, IBAN: AE000...).
○ Note: We don't expect enterprise-grade DLP in 48 hours, but we expect a functional
implementation (Regex, NER, or Local PII models like Glínêr/Presidio) that proves you
take security seriously.
Objective 3: The "Rent vs. Buy" Engine (Commercial Logic)
A calculator gives a number. A Founder's Office Engineer builds a narrative.
● The Task: Implement a deterministic "Opportunity Cost" calculation.
● The Requirement:
○ If the user is renting, the bot must mathematically demonstrate the loss.
○ Bad Output: "Buying might be better."
○ Good Output: "You are currently paying 140,000 AED/year in rent. Over the next 5
years, that is 700,000 AED—essentially burning a Ferrari. If you buy, that money
builds equity. Here is the chart."
Objective 4: The "Closer" (Conversion Orchestration)
Your goal is not to chat forever. It is to get the user to the next stage.
● The Task: The conversation must culminate in a "Soft Close."
● The Requirement:
○ The bot must detect when the user is convinced (based on sentiment or flow).
○ It must trigger a specific Lead Capture event.
○ Example: "Based on your salary of 25k and the current market rates, you are
pre-qualified for a 1.5M AED home in JVC. Shall I generate your Pre-Approval
Certificate now?"
3. Deliverables
We are not just looking at code; we are looking at your thinking process.
1. The Evolved Prototype (Live Link)
● Must handle a file upload.
● Must demonstrate the "Rent vs. Buy" logic.
● Must attempt to capture the lead.
2. The Architecture Walkthrough (Loom Video - Mandatory)● Time Limit: 5 Minutes Max.
● The "Black Box" Reveal:
○ Privacy: Show us the code/logic that protects the PII. How are you scrubbing the
data?
○ Data Flow: Explain how the data moves from Upload -> Extraction -> Calculation ->
Persuasion.
○ The Stack: Why did you choose these specific tools/models?
3. The Repo
● Clean, readable code. We will check your PII handling logic specifically.
4. Evaluation Criteria
We will grade this submission on the following weightage:
● Security & Architecture (35%): Did you lazily send user secrets to the cloud, or did you
build a vault?
● Product Thinking (35%): Does the bot actually sell the value of buying, or is it just a
passive tool?
● Engineering Velocity (20%): How much functionality did you ship in this short sprint?
● UX/Polish (10%): Is the flow smooth?
Good luck. Build something you’d trust with your own bank details.
